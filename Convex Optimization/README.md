This folder is dedicated to the homeworks given in Alexandre d'Aspremont's code on Convex Optimization. It contains all three homeworks: 
- TP1: Basic exercises on showing convexity / strong convexity / quasi-convexity as well as conjugate functions
- TP2: LP Problem and Duality
- TP3: Newton's method, barrier method
